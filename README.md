# minishell1


Epitech's minishell1 project in C language. 


For this project it's necessary to reproduce a Shell with Linux command management. We had to copy tcsh who is a Unix shell based on and compatible with the C.

## Requirements

Navigate to the root of the repository from your Terminal and run make to build the mysh executable file.
